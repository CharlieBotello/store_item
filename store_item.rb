# Exercise: 
# A. Use the terminal to create a new folder in your actualize folder called object_oriented_ruby.

# B. Create a new file in the folder called store_item.rb and open it in Sublime.

# C. Use hashes with symbols to represent the following scenario:
#      C.1 - You are the owner of a store that sells items (you decide what specifically). Each item has various properties such as color, price, etc.
#      C.2 - Represent 3 items using hashes. Each hash should have the same keys with different values.
#      C.3 - Be sure to use symbols for the keys. Try creating hashes using both types of hash symbol syntaxes. (Ruby syntax {:a => 123} vs. “JavaScript” syntax {a: 123}).





# item_1 = {:description => "apple", :color => "red", :price => 5 :available => true}
# item_2 = {description: "phone", :color "white", price: 200, available: true}
# item_3 = {description: "computer", color: "red", price: 500, available: true}







# Exercise: Rewrite your store items using a class instead of a hash.
# a) Choose which attributes should have “reader” methods and which attributes should have “writer” methods.
# b) Create an instance from your store item class. Use puts statements to print the 3 attributes individually to the terminal.



# Exercise: Replace your getter and setter methods using the attr_reader and attr_writer shortcuts!
# Bonus: Read more about how attr_reader works its magic (advanced stuff here)
